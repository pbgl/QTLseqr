\title{Plots Gprime distribution}
\usage{
plotGprimeDist(
  SNPset,
  outlierFilter = c("deltaSNP", "Hampel"),
  filterThreshold = 0.1,
  binwidth = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SNPset}{a data frame with SNPs and genotype fields as imported by
\code{ImportFromGATK} and after running \code{GetPrimeStats}}

\item{outlierFilter}{one of either "deltaSNP" or "Hampel". Method for
filtering outlier (ie QTL) regions for p-value estimation}

\item{filterThreshold}{The absolute delta SNP index to use to filter out
putative QTL (default = 0.1)}

\item{binwidth}{The binwidth for the histogram. Recomended and default = 0.5}
}
\value{
Plots a ggplot histogram of the G' value distribution. The raw data
  as well as the filtered G' values (excluding putatitve QTL) are plotted. It
  will then overlay an estimated log normal distribution with the same mean
  and variance as the null G' distribution. This will allow to verify if
  after filtering your G' value appear to be close to log normally and thus
  can be used to estimate p-values using the non-parametric estimation method
  described in Magwene et al. (2011). Breifly, using the natural log of
  Gprime a median absolute deviation (MAD) is calculated. The Gprime set is
  trimmed to exclude outlier regions (i.e. QTL) based on Hampel's rule. An
  estimation of the mode of the trimmed set is calculated using the
  \code{\link[modeest]{mlv}} function from the package modeest. Finally, the
  mean and variance of the set are estimated using the median and mode are
  estimated and used to plot the log normal distribution.
