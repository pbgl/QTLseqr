\title{Plots different paramaters for QTL identification}
\usage{
plotQTLStats(
  SNPset,
  subset = NULL,
  var = "nSNPs",
  scaleChroms = TRUE,
  line = TRUE,
  plotThreshold = FALSE,
  plotIntervals = FALSE,
  q = 0.05,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SNPset}{a data frame with SNPs and genotype fields as imported by
\code{ImportFromGATK} and after running \code{runGprimeAnalysis} or \code{runQTLseqAnalysis}}

\item{subset}{a vector of chromosome names for use in quick plotting of
chromosomes of interest. Defaults to
NULL and will plot all chromosomes in the SNPset}

\item{var}{character. The paramater for plotting. Must be one of: "nSNPs",
"deltaSNP", "Gprime", "negLog10Pval"}

\item{scaleChroms}{boolean. if TRUE (default) then chromosome facets will be 
scaled to relative chromosome sizes. If FALSE all facets will be equal
sizes. This is basically a convenience argument for setting both scales and 
shape as "free_x" in ggplot2::facet_grid.}

\item{line}{boolean. If TRUE will plot line graph. If FALSE will plot points.
Plotting points will take more time.}

\item{plotThreshold}{boolean. Should we plot the False Discovery Rate
threshold (FDR). Only plots line if var is "Gprime" or "negLogPval".}

\item{plotIntervals}{boolean. Whether or not to plot the two-sided Takagi confidence intervals in "deltaSNP" plots.}

\item{q}{numeric. The q-value to use as the FDR threshold. If too low, no
line will be drawn and a warning will be given.}

\item{...}{arguments to pass to ggplot2::geom_line or ggplot2::geom_point for
changing colors etc.}
}
\value{
Plots a ggplot graph for all chromosomes or those requested in
  \code{subset}. By setting \code{var} to "nSNPs" the distribution of SNPs
  used to calculate G' will be plotted. "deltaSNP" will plot a tri-cube
  weighted delta SNP-index for each SNP. "Gprime" will plot the tri-cube
  weighted G' value. Setting "negLogPval" will plot the -log10 of the p-value
  at each SNP. In "Gprime" and "negLogPval" plots, a genome wide FDR threshold of
  q can be drawn by setting "plotThreshold" to TRUE. The defualt is a red
  line. If you would like to plot a different line we suggest setting
  "plotThreshold" to FALSE and manually adding a line using
  ggplot2::geom_hline.
}
\description{
A wrapper for ggplot to plot genome wide distribution of parameters used to
identify QTL.

\examples{
p <- plotQTLstats(df_filt_6Mb, var = "Gprime", plotThreshold = TRUE, q = 0.01, subset = c("Chr3","Chr4"))
