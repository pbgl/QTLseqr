\title{Imports SNP data from GATK VariablesToTable output}
\usage{
importFromGATK(
  file,
  highBulk = character(),
  lowBulk = character(),
  chromList = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The name of the GATK VariablesToTable output .table file which the
data are to be read from.}

\item{highBulk}{The sample name of the High Bulk}

\item{lowBulk}{The sample name of the Low Bulk}

\item{chromList}{a string vector of the chromosomes to be used in the
analysis. Useful for filtering out unwanted contigs etc.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame containing columns for Read depth (DP),
  Reference Allele Depth (AD_REF) and Alternative Allele Depth (AD_ALT),
  Genoytype Quality (GQ) and SNPindex for each bulk (indicated by .HIGH and
  .LOW column name suffix). Total reference allele frequnce "REF_FRQ" is the
  sum of AD.REF for both bulks divided by total Depth for that SNP. The
  deltaSNPindex is equal to  SNPindex.HIGH - SNPindex.LOW. The GStat column
  is the calculated G statistic for that SNP.
}
\description{
Imports SNP data from the output of the
\href{https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_variantutils_VariantsToTable.php}{VariantsToTable}
function in GATK. After importing the data, the function then calculates
total reference allele frequency for both bulks together, the delta SNP index
(i.e. SNP index of the low bulk subtracted from the SNP index of the high
bulk), the G statistic and returns a data frame. The required GATK fields
(-F) are CHROM (Chromosome) and POS (Position). The required Genotype fields
(-GF) are AD (Allele Depth), DP (Depth). Recommended
fields are REF (Reference allele) and ALT (Alternative allele) Recommended
Genotype feilds are PL (Phred-scaled likelihoods) and GQ  (Genotype Quality).
