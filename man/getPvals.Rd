\title{Non-parametric estimation of the null distribution of G'}
\usage{
getPvals(
  Gprime,
  deltaSNP = NULL,
  outlierFilter = c("deltaSNP", "Hampel"),
  filterThreshold
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Gprime}{a vector of G prime values (tricube weighted G statistics)}

\item{deltaSNP}{a vector of delta SNP values for use for QTL region filtering}

\item{outlierFilter}{one of either "deltaSNP" or "Hampel". Method for
filtering outlier (ie QTL) regions for p-value estimation}

\item{filterThreshold}{The absolute delta SNP index to use to filter out putative QTL}
}
\description{
The function is used by \code{\link{runGprimeAnalysis}} to estimate p-values for the
weighted G' statistic based on the non-parametric estimation method described
in Magwene et al. 2011. Breifly, using the natural log of Gprime a median
absolute deviation (MAD) is calculated. The Gprime set is trimmed to exclude
outlier regions (i.e. QTL) based on Hampel's rule. An alternate method for
filtering out QTL is proposed using absolute delta SNP indeces greater than
a set threshold to filter out potential QTL. An estimation of the mode of the trimmed set
is calculated using the \code{\link[modeest]{mlv}} function from the package
modeest. Finally, the mean and variance of the set are estimated using the
median and mode and p-values are estimated from a log normal distribution.
